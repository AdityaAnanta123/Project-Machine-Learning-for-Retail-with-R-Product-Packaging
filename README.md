# Project: Machine Learning for Retail with R - Product Packaging
## Overview
This project applies association rule mining to analyze retail transactions data. The aim is to identify useful product combinations based on transaction patterns and packaging strategies, helping retailers to make better stocking and marketing decisions.

The R script and its accompanying text files are designed to uncover valuable insights from the data, such as frequent product combinations and slow-moving items.

## Files in the Project
Project Machine Learning for Retail with R_Product Packaging.R
This R script performs the following tasks:

Reading Transaction Data: The file reads retail transaction data from a .tsv (Tab-separated values) file.
Association Rule Mining: Using the Apriori algorithm, the script identifies frequent itemsets and generates rules that suggest which products are often bought together.
Product Combinations: Filters the associations based on lift, which measures the strength of the association, and applies constraints such as minimum support and confidence.
Top and Slow-Moving Products: The script identifies both top-selling products and slow-moving items, and sorts them based on the association strength.
Saving Results: Results are saved into .txt files for further analysis.
bottom10_item_retail.txt
This file contains the bottom 10 items in terms of their frequency or sales in the retail transaction data. It helps to identify products with the lowest sales or those that do not perform well in the retail environment.

## kombinasi_retail.txt
This file contains product combinations that are frequently purchased together. It is the output of the association rule mining process, showing products that often co-occur in the same transactions. These combinations are filtered based on lift and are crucial for creating effective marketing and bundling strategies.

## kombinasi_retail_slow_moving.txt
This file contains slow-moving product combinations, which are combinations of products that have a low sales velocity or are not purchased frequently. Retailers can use this information to make decisions about product packaging, promotions, or potential stock removals.

## top10_item_retail.txt
This file lists the top 10 items based on their frequency or sales, providing insights into which products are performing the best in the retail space. This information is useful for inventory management and product promotion.
